- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Praise-Peter
- My interests are computers, art, and data analysis
-I'm currently learning how to code, improving my art, and learning about data analysis
-  You may reach me on my email praisepeter2011@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a cat person, but I do like dogs. I love to learn about animals and spend my free time coding or drawing. My favourite colour is black as it reminds me of the galaxy, and is my favourite colour to wear as it goes well with every colour. I hope to improve on all the skills I'm learning. Thank you for reading. ðŸ’–
Here is the link to a code I was doing. I did this just for fun and to practice coding: href="https://[www.example.com](http://127.0.0.1:5501/IDK.html)">Visit Example</a>
